# Summary
### The results show that the largest category of ridership are primarily males and use the bikes to commute to and from work. It would be advised to target that market first before moving onto weekend leisure riding. It would be recommended to also create analysis that compares the density of office space to the most popular drop-off locations as well as look at the availabity of bike lanes between the most popular drop-off points.
